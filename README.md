# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used contains sonar readings from underwater sources, and the goal is to develop an accurate classifier for differentiating between these two classes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 60 numerical features representing energy readings at different frequencies. The target variable has two classes:
- **R**: Rock
- **M**: Mine

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Normalization/Standardization
   - Feature selection (if applicable)
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of features
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Data visualization using seaborn/matplotlib

3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Neural Networks
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score

5. **Deployment** (if applicable)
   - API using Flask/FastAPI
   - Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

### Running the Model
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved **X% accuracy** with optimized hyperparameters.
- The confusion matrix analysis showed **balanced/misclassified** results for class predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with deep learning models like CNNs.
- Implement real-time classification with streaming data.
